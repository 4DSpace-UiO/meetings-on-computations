# Welcome to the Meetings on Computations of Plasmas

Welcome to the
[4DSpace](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/projects/4dspace/)
Meetings on Computations. Let's meet regularly and discuss computational
methods and simulations of plasmas. Each meeting starts with a 15 to 60 minute
informal presentation on some topic, followed by discussions. While the
meetings are tailored towards the computational scientists, we invite everyone
to attend and even present. Topics of presentations may range from methods and
implementations to applications. We will maintain a schedule of presentations
below that should be indicative of the contents and technical detail of the
presentations.

Time: Every second Tuesday 13:30 - 14:30 (unless otherwise stated).

Events with invited speakers (bold) are open to a broader audience.
