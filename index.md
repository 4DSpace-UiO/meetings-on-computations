# Welcome to the Meetings on Computational Physics

The study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics is the norm for modern research. It started as one of the first applications of modern computers in science, and has now become a subset of computational science. Whether being considered a subdiscipline of theoretical physics or an intermediate branch between theoretical and experimental physics, computational physics is regarded as an integral part of the world of research.

At [4DSpace](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/projects/4dspace/), we believe in an open-sourced culture for computation. We thrive on exchanging ideas to create better algorithms for solving intricate physics problems. With such a purpose, we are inviting experts from different universities and laboratories around the world to share their knowledge and guide young researchers in their respective fields, as well as to stimulate discussions amongst more experienced researchers. Such meetings will be open to the public.

The schedule for the meetings is provided at the bottom, and will be continually updated.
