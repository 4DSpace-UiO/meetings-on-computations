## Welcome to Meetings on Computational Physics

The study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics is the norm for modern research. However, it started as the first application of modern computers in science, now has become a subset of computational science. Whether being considered a subdiscipline of theoretical physics or an intermediate branch between theoretical and experimental physics, computational physics is regarded as an integral part of the research world.

Here at 4DSpace, we believe in open-sourced culture for computation. We thrive on exchanging ideas to create better algorithms for solving intricate physics problems. With such a purpose, we are inviting experts from different universities and laboratories around the world to share their knowledge and guide young researchers in their respective fields. Such meetings will be held once a month and will be open to the public. 

The schedule for such meetings is provided below.
