# Inference of particle sensor measurements: Beyond analytic models

## Abstract
The accurate inference of plasma parameters from particle sensor measurements remains a daunting
challenge, despite of the many experimental and theoretical studies reported over nearly a century.
Thus far, due to the need for “light weight” fast algorithms in lab or space experiments, inferences have
almost exclusively been based on approximate analytic expressions. The use of computer modelling
combined with multivariate regressions is presented as a promising alternative. Computer simulations
can be used to calculate sensor responses under realistic conditions, and used to construct data sets
from which regression models can be trained and validated, to infer plasma conditions from low level
L1B measurements. Combined with dedicated campaigns of measurements, this could lead to a change
of paradigm in the inference of probe and sensor measurements.
