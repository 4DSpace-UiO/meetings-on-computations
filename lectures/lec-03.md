Dr. Rakesh Moulick is an Assistant Professor with a background in Computational Plasma Physics at Rangapara College, Assam, India. His research goal is to meet the academic and industry orientations. He is focused on writing codes to simulate the plasma behavior with an interest in the background ion-neutral collision dynamics. He takes a keen interest in writing scientific articles and passionate about communicating science.

## Abstract
The ion neutral collision can cause intriguing dust charging phenomena that are completely different from what would be expected based on the classic orbit motion limiting theory. The potential around the dust grain is explored in the presence of ion neutral collisions in this paper. For the one-dimensional radial coordinate, fluid equations are solved. It has been discovered that as the ion neutral collision increases, the potential structure around the dust grain changes shape and diverges from the standard Debye-Huckel nature. The deviation starts at a certain value of the ion neutral collision parameter and continues for any higher values. The potential variation ascertains the fact that there exists a region of attraction for the negative charges in the neighborhood of the dust grain at sufficiently high collision. The modeling is done for the full range of plasma, i.e., considering the bulk and the sheath jointly. The potential variance with collision is explicitly illustrated, and the variation is determined to be sufficient to account for the preceding data.
